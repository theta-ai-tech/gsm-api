# Epic E — Tab 1 PLAY: Endpoints & Documentation

## Design Decisions
- **Broadcasts & Offers**: Top-level Firestore collections (`broadcasts/{id}`, `offers/{id}`)
- **State source**: Persisted `playTab` map on user doc, synced by API transactions (triggers later as backstops)
- **Write scope**: GET /me/state + core writes (broadcast CRUD, offer send/accept/decline/cancel)
- **Broadcast limit**: One active broadcast per user at a time
- **Offer flow**: Broadcast stays live while offers queue up; user picks from multiple challengers
- **Freshness**: GET /me/state reconciles time-based expirations on read (broadcast TTL, offer expiry, scheduledAt)

## Issues

### E1: Documentation — Firestore schema for broadcasts & offers
Add `broadcasts/{broadcastId}` and `offers/{offerId}` collection schemas to `wiki/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` and `wiki/dbschema.md`.

**Files**:
- `wiki/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` — Add broadcasts + offers collection field tables, enums, examples
- `wiki/dbschema.md` — Add broadcasts + offers collection entries

---

### E2: Documentation — playTab field on users/{uid}
Add the new `playTab` cache map to the user doc schema.

**Files**:
- `wiki/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` — Add playTab fields to users collection
- `wiki/dbschema.md` — Add playTab to users collection sketch

---

### E3: Documentation — New enums
Document `BroadcastStatusEnum`, `AvailabilityEnum`, `CourtStatusEnum`, `OfferStatusEnum` in the models wiki.

**Files**:
- `wiki/models.md` — Add new enums section
- `wiki/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` — Add enum definitions to Enums section

---

### E4: Documentation — Updated state machine diagram
Replace the existing state machine in `arch/me_state_machine.md` with a refined version that accounts for BROADCAST_ACTIVE coexisting with queued offers.

**Files**:
- `arch/me_state_machine.md` — Updated mermaid diagram with offer queue nuances + notes

---

### E5: Documentation — /me/state response envelope & mode payloads
Define the full response contract: envelope shape, mode-specific payload examples for all 9 states.

**Files**:
- `wiki/me-state.md` — Expand with envelope definition, payload per mode, examples
- `spec/tab1-play-payloads.md` — New file with full JSON examples per mode

---

### E6: Documentation — Endpoint specs for all Tab 1 endpoints
Document all 7 endpoints with method, path, auth, request/response shapes, errors.

**Files**:
- `wiki/endpoints.md` — Add all /me/* endpoint documentation

---

### E7: Code — New enums in models/enums.py
Add `BroadcastStatusEnum`, `AvailabilityEnum`, `CourtStatusEnum`, `OfferStatusEnum`.

**Files**:
- `api/app/models/enums.py`

---

### E8: Code — Pydantic models for play tab
Create request/response models: `MeStateResponse`, broadcast/offer request bodies, mode-specific payload models.

**Files**:
- `api/app/models/play.py` (new)

---

### E9: Code — BroadcastsRepo & OffersRepo
Firestore CRUD for broadcasts and offers collections.

- `api/app/repos/offers_repo.py` (new)
- `api/app/dependencies/repos.py` — Add get_broadcasts_repo(), get_offers_repo()

---

### E10: Code — PlayService (state computation + transactional writes)
Core business logic: state derivation, freshness reconciliation, broadcast/offer/match transitions.

**Files**:
- `api/app/services/play_service.py` (new)

---

### E11: Code — GET /me/state endpoint
Implement the read endpoint with freshness reconciliation.

**Files**:
- `api/app/routers/play.py` (new)
- `api/app/main.py` — Remove placeholder, include play router

---

### E12: Code — POST /me/broadcast + DELETE /me/broadcast
Create and cancel broadcast endpoints.

**Files**:
- `api/app/routers/play.py`

---

### E13: Code — POST /me/offers (send challenge)
Send an offer/challenge to another user.

### State Machine (refined)

```
DISCOVERY
  |- POST /me/broadcast           -> BROADCAST_ACTIVE
  |- POST /me/offers              -> OUTGOING_OFFER_PENDING
  |- (receive offer, no broadcast) -> INCOMING_OFFER_PENDING

BROADCAST_ACTIVE
  |- (receive offers)              -> stays BROADCAST_ACTIVE (offers queue in pendingIncomingOfferIds)
  |- POST /me/offers/{id}/accept   -> MATCH_SCHEDULED (cancel broadcast + decline others)
  |- DELETE /me/broadcast          -> DISCOVERY (decline all pending offers)
  |- (broadcast TTL expires)       -> DISCOVERY (freshness reconciliation)

OUTGOING_OFFER_PENDING
  |- (offer accepted by recipient) -> MATCH_SCHEDULED
  |- (offer declined/expired)      -> DISCOVERY or BROADCAST_ACTIVE (if broadcast still active)
  |- POST /me/offers/{id}/cancel   -> DISCOVERY or BROADCAST_ACTIVE

INCOMING_OFFER_PENDING (no active broadcast)
  |- POST /me/offers/{id}/accept   -> MATCH_SCHEDULED
  |- POST /me/offers/{id}/decline  -> DISCOVERY
  |- (offer expires)               -> DISCOVERY

MATCH_SCHEDULED
  |- (scheduledAt passes)          -> POST_MATCH_LOG_AVAILABLE (freshness reconciliation)

POST_MATCH_LOG_AVAILABLE
  |- (user submits score)          -> POST_MATCH_WAITING_OPPONENT
  |- (opponent submits score)      -> POST_MATCH_CONFIRM_REQUIRED

POST_MATCH_CONFIRM_REQUIRED
  |- (user confirms)               -> POST_MATCH_WAITING_OPPONENT / completed -> DISCOVERY
  |- (user rejects)                -> MATCH_DISPUTED

POST_MATCH_WAITING_OPPONENT
  |- (opponent confirms)           -> completed -> DISCOVERY
  |- (conflicting submission)      -> MATCH_DISPUTED

MATCH_DISPUTED
  |- (resolved)                    -> DISCOVERY
```

## Execution Order

Documentation first (E1-E6), then code (E7-E15). Each issue is reviewed and approved individually before implementation.
