# Functions (D-series)

This page tracks the D-series Firestore trigger work and the intended behavior for each task.

Diagrams live in `arch/`:
- `arch/match_lifecycle.md`
- `arch/league_member_triggers.md`

## D1.1 — onMatchWrite: upcoming cache qualification
Purpose: Detect match writes that should update each participant's upcoming matches cache.

### Behavior summary
- A match qualifies as "upcoming" when:
  - `status == "scheduled"`
  - `scheduledAt` is a timezone-aware UTC timestamp strictly in the future
- Ignore:
  - deletes
  - non-scheduled statuses (`completed`, `cancelled`, `pending_confirmation`, `disputed`, etc.)
  - past or missing `scheduledAt`
  - no-op updates (no change to `status`, `scheduledAt`, or `participantUids`)

### How it is called
- Intended to run inside a Firestore trigger (Cloud Functions Gen 2) on
  `matches/{matchId}` document writes (create/update).
- Not called from API server code.

### What it updates
- D1.1 adds only qualification logic; no Firestore updates occur yet.
- Later D tasks will use the qualification result to push match IDs into each participant's
  upcoming cache.

### Cache note
- The "cache" here is a denormalized list stored on `users/{uid}` in Firestore, not an in-memory
  cache. It enables a single document read instead of multiple match queries.

## D1.2 — transactional upcoming cache update
Purpose: Atomically update each participant user doc to include a scheduled match in the
upcoming cache, ordered by `scheduledAt` and capped to 10.

### Behavior summary
- Uses a transaction per user doc to update:
  - `upcomingMatches` (canonical cache for ordering)
  - `upcomingMatchIds` (derived list of IDs, for compatibility)
- Updates are idempotent, deduped, ordered by `scheduledAt` ASC, and capped.
- Writes are skipped if the computed cache is unchanged.

### Trigger flow
- D1.1 detection runs first; on qualify, D1.2 updates each participant uid.

### What happens on a qualifying write
- For each participant, a transaction updates `upcomingMatches` (ordered by `scheduledAt`, capped).
- `upcomingMatchIds` is derived from that ordered cache for compatibility.
- No-op updates are skipped when the cache would not change.

### Where it runs
- This logic is intended for Firestore triggers on `matches/{matchId}` writes.

## D1.3 — upcoming cache cap & dedupe guards
Purpose: Prove cache update behavior is robust against duplicate events and full lists.

### Behavior summary
- Insert into empty list adds the match once.
- Duplicate events do not create duplicates.
- Ordering is deterministic by `scheduledAt` ascending.
- Cache is capped at 10; adding an 11th drops the oldest by `scheduledAt`.

## D2.1 — completion transition detection
Purpose: Trigger completion migration only on the first `scheduled` → `completed` transition.

### Behavior summary
- Requires `before.status == "scheduled"` and `after.status == "completed"`.
- Requires `finishedAt` to exist and be timezone-aware.
- Ignores idempotent repeats (`completed` → `completed`) and other status changes.

## D2.2 — migrate upcoming → completed cache
Purpose: Move a completed match out of upcoming and into recent completed, per participant.

### Behavior summary
- Removes `matchId` from `upcomingMatches`.
- Inserts `matchId` into `completedMatches` ordered by `finishedAt` DESC.
- Deduped and capped at 10.
- Updates `upcomingMatchIds` and `recentCompletedMatchIds` as derived lists.

## D3.1 — league member upsert into user summaries
Purpose: Maintain user league summaries on membership create/update.

### Behavior summary
- Triggered by `leagues/{leagueId}/members/{uid}` writes when member is active and role/status changed.
- Reads league doc and member doc to compose summary `{leagueId, sport, status, name, role}`.
- Upserts into `users/{uid}.leaguesActive` or `leaguesCompleted` based on league status.
- Deduped by `leagueId`, capped at 20, and avoids no-op writes.

### What gets updated
- On active membership writes, the user doc is updated so the league appears in the correct
  section:
  - `leaguesActive` when league status is `active`
  - `leaguesCompleted` when league status is `completed` (or non-active)
  - Removed from the other list to keep them disjoint

## D3.2 — league member removal from user summaries
Purpose: Remove league summaries when membership is deleted or becomes non-active.

### Behavior summary
- Triggered by `leagues/{leagueId}/members/{uid}` deletes or status changes to `left`/`banned`.
- Removes the league entry from both `leaguesActive` and `leaguesCompleted`.
- Idempotent under retries (no-op if already removed).
